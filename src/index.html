            10. Evaluate the effect of using oracles (whether implicit or
            explicit) on smart contracts. Assess the quantitative
            vulnerabilities, such as arbitrage attacks, in which an adversary
            can slowly deplete a smart contract of its tokens. (It should be
            noted that these attacks are typically undetected by a security
            audit.) Investigate what catastrophic scenarios could abruptly
            reduce the company's value (for instance, Luna/UST had numerous
            vulnerabilities) and estimate their likelihood.
